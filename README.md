# Date
Went on a date, made an app for it. 

This project was an excuse to explore the mobile compass and gps apis, angular 5 and progressive web apps. The idea was that the user was presented a compass with an arrow indicating which direction they should head towards, once within 100m of the destination they were able to progress towards the next checkpoint.
